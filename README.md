# Phalanx
High-level architectural representation of the Phalanx platform (last version 19/09/2019), which is described as an "EDR/XDR as a Service" with homomorphic/cryptographic analysis capabilities.

![Phalanx](https://github.com/hashburst/phalanx/assets/55950175/b29a109f-a458-41d4-a9ed-1ea9ac85c67f)

Phalanx is a service that provides Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) capabilities. It leverages homomorphic encryption and cryptographic analysis to enhance security. This means that Phalanx can analyze encrypted data without decrypting it, thereby maintaining data privacy while still being able to detect and respond to security threats.

Key elements:

- Master Nodes Cluster: This represents the core infrastructure of the Phalanx platform, likely running on a cloud computing environment.

- Workstation (WS) Cluster: These are the endpoint devices that the Phalanx service monitors and protects, likely using an EDR/XDR approach.

- API: This provides the interface for interacting with the Phalanx platform, likely for integrating with other applications or services.

- Virtual Machine Cluster: This represents the underlying compute resources that host the Phalanx platform and the web applications it supports.

- Web App: This indicates that the Phalanx platform can also host and run web-based applications.

- LAN Segment: The diagram suggests that the Phalanx platform can integrate with and monitor devices on a local area network (LAN) environment.

- Software as a Service (SaaS): The diagram indicates that Phalanx is positioned as a SaaS offering, providing security and monitoring capabilities as a service to its users.

Overall, **Phalanx is as a cloud-based**, **platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution** that offers advanced security and monitoring capabilities, leveraging techniques like **homomorphic encryption** and **cryptographic analysis to protect customer data and systems**.
